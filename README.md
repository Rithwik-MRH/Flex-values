# Flex-values
Getting analog to digital convertor values from a flex sensor

The given code will display the ADC values in an lcd board

This project is done on Arduino UNO board using Arduino IDE software

INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT:
1. Arduino Board
2. LCD board (16*2 lcd board is used here)
3. Flex Sensor
4. Jumper wires
5. Bread board

Procedure:

STEP 1: Download the arduino IDE software

STEP 2: Download the liquid crystal library for arduino 

STEP 3: Add the zip file to the software in the "include library " in the software

STEP 4: Enter the code

STEP 5: Connect the arduino board to your computer with all the circuit connections 

STEP 6: Select the port and click "upload" button

STEP 7: The LCD board and the serial monitor will display the values from the sensor
